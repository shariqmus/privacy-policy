  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

  <section>
    <p><strong>Shariq Mustaquim Digital</strong> (“we”, “our”, or “us”) develops and publishes mobile applications (“apps”) available on Google Play and Apple App Store. 
    This Privacy Policy applies to all our apps unless a specific app provides its own separate policy.</p>

    <p>We are committed to protecting your privacy. This document explains how we collect, use, and safeguard your information when you use any of our apps.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Information Collection and Use</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Our apps may collect limited technical data (such as device type, crash logs, and usage statistics) to help us improve performance and user experience.</li>
      <li>Some apps may request access to device features or data (such as camera, storage, microphone, or location) only when necessary to provide the app’s core functionality.</li>
      <li>We do not collect personally identifiable information (such as name, email, or phone number) unless you explicitly provide it (for example, when contacting us for support).</li>
      <li>We do not sell or share your personal data with third parties, except as required by law or through trusted service providers (e.g., analytics or crash reporting tools).</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Permissions</h2>
    <p>Different apps may request different permissions (such as camera or location). These permissions are used strictly for the intended functionality of the app and not for any unrelated purpose.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>Our apps are not directed at children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal data from children. If we learn that a child has provided personal information, we will delete it as soon as possible.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Security</h2>
    <p>We value your trust and strive to use industry-standard measures to protect your information. However, no method of electronic storage or transmission over the internet is 100% secure.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Updates will be posted on this page with a new “Last Updated” date. We encourage you to review it periodically.</p>
